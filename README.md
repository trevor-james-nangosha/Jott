# JOTT

This is a diary/journal application. It is inspired by the `RedNotebook` application that is available on Ubuntu.  
This application supports local storage as well as cloud storage, so that you can back up your journal entries for access on other devices.

Hope you enjoy using it.  
Feel free to report any bugs.
